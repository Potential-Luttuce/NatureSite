# NatureSite

## *Some elemtns in each doc have inline css style - all content pages have style tag in header for color.<hr>
### This is My Nature site
### For Pictures I have taken on various walks in my area.
I hope you enjoy these cute pics, but this is mostly so i can continue practicing code & Web Development. Feel free to let me know what is your favorite animal, but also feel free to give feedback on my code. 

Thank you - Mike


# To Do :
> Home Page(landing)

> Images
1. Add all images for the site to the Images DIR in their own respective DIR

> Animal sites
1. Create animals sites for each animal in my pics
2. Will probably need to add STYLE tag to each html for individual coloring of elements - they should all have similar functionality and layout. 
    > Turtle
    1. Use template with sidebar from other project
